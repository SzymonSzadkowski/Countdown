Countdown timer

This is another project using HTML, CSS and JS. It counts down the time to the ending of a giveaway on a page. It is responsive and dynamic - it changes according to the current date. After the time runs out, there is proper message. First time I have encoutered so much Data() attribute in JS.

I used:
- a lot of Data() attribute
- setInterval() for the first time
